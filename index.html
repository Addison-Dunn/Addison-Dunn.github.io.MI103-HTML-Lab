    <h3> HOLLOW KNIGHT: Silksong </h3>

    <p> Hollow Knight: Silksong is the sequal to Hollow Knight, realesed in 2025, it lets you play as one of the villains
        from the original game named Hornet.
    </p>
    <p> Silksong is the best souls-like/metroidvania game created, my favorite aspect being the 200+ unique boss fights</p>

    <h4> Silksong boss fights </h4>

    <p> Boss fights in Silksong are different from Hollow Knight in many aspects. to beat a Silksong boss, requires you to <br>
        forget everything you thought you knew about the game mechanics and combat system, and re-learn how to play against <br>
        a given boss, Team Cherry really went all out to develope each of the 200+ bosses with this core idea.

    <h5> My top 5 Silksong Boss Fights in no particular order</h5>
    <ol>
         <li> "Little Ghost" <br>
                this is the guy that you play as in the first game so <br>
                it was cool playing against yourself and truely it was <br>
                a fromsoft moment.<br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight#:~:text=The%20player%20controls%20the%20Knight,plagued%20by%20a%20supernatural%20disease.">the knight</a> </li>
         <li> "Zote the grey knight" <br>
                he doesn't do anything to you so he's super easy to kill <br>
                which makes him the most fun boss in the game, and my favorite character <br>
                <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Zote">zote</a> </li>
         <li> "big grub" <br>
                in the first game you collect all the lost grubs around the world <br>
                thinking that you were saving them but it turns out their dad eats <br>
                them all and theres nothing you can do about it! in this fight you <br>
                get to actually save all the grubs <br>
                <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Grubfather">grub father</a> </li>
         <li> "the pale king" <br>
                this is the final boss of the whole game, who was even teased in the <br>
                first game, but everyone thought he was dead, actually he is the main <br>
                antagonist and he is trying to take everyone's dark souls *spoilers* <br>
                his fight is certainly the hardest Team Cherry boss fight while also <br> 
                being quite fun. 9/10 <br>
                <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Pale_King">pale king</a> </li>
         <li> "Soldier of Godrick" <br>
                Soldier of Godrick was a boss which many players had the hardest time <br>
                with, but I personally, beat him first try, pretty cool boss but didn't <br>
                feel like a normal hollow knight boss, I though it was strange choice <br>
                to use a 3d model for him instead of 2d sprites 10/10 <br>
